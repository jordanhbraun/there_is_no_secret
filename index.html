		<p class="lead">Tips for success, lifehacks, habits of successful people... it's all bullshit, and everyone should stop wasting their time reading and writing those articles. There is no secret sauce for effectiveness, success, or productivity. This may come as a shock to many, but it all comes down to hard work. Having a hard time focusing? You just need to try harder. Want to get twice as much done? Work twice as much.</br></br>

		How many articles can possibly be written about getting enough sleep, exercising, and eating healthy? Why are people consuming this? I have a sneaking suspicion that it all comes down to <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergophobia">ergophobia.</a> Most people aren't hard workers. The startup community is plagued with talkers and brainstormers. Reading articles about working <i>feels</i> like working, but it's not. Only working is working. So here's my one tip for success: Work harder.</br></br>

		Work longer hours, get up earlier, go out less, do whatever it takes. Your dad was right when he went on rants about elbow grease and gumption. Hard work pays off. Elon Musk and Richard Branson aren't sitting around reading dumbass articles on Buzzfeed and Lifehacker... they're working, they're crushing it, they know that there is no secret sauce.
